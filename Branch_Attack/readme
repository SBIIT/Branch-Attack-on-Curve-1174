1. First generate the secret scalar and scalar splitted values

>> mkdir saved
>> python initiate.py arg1 arg2
where arg1 = number of bits in secret scalar
arg2 = number of traces to be collected

2.Collect traces of branch misses for both the split scalar and the random binary
>> python collect_trace.py 
generates traces of both the split scalar and random binary 

3. python wrapper.py 45 
To run the analysis for the 45th bit

Outputs the result for the secret scalar bit at the 45th location
